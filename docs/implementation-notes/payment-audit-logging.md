# Payment Audit Logging Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Payment System (Weeks 3-4)

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Payment Audit Logging system, which is a **CRITICAL** component for dispute resolution and debugging payment issues. Every payment decision and action is now logged to the `PaymentAuditLog` table.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Audit Logging Utility Function ✅

**Location:** [app/actions/payments.ts:30-47](../app/actions/payments.ts)

```typescript
async function logPaymentAudit(paymentId: string, action: string, details: Record<string, any>);
```

**Features:**

- Asynchronous logging that never blocks payment processing
- Graceful error handling (logs errors to console but doesn't fail payments)
- Stores structured data in JSON format
- Automatic timestamp via Prisma's `createdAt` field

### 2. Payment Source Selection Logging ✅

**Action:** `source_selected`
**Location:** [app/actions/payments.ts:118-125](../app/actions/payments.ts)

**Details Captured:**

- Payment source type (GIFT_CERTIFICATE, CREDIT_CARD, CASH, OTHER)
- Payment amount
- Appointment ID
- User who selected the source (email)
- Gift certificate code (if applicable)
- Timestamp

### 3. Payment Attempt Logging ✅

**Actions:**

- `gift_certificate_payment_attempt` (line 240)
- `credit_card_payment_attempt` (line 289)
- `manual_payment_processed` (line 361)

**Details Captured:**

- Payment method
- Amount being charged
- Amount in cents (for Stripe)
- Gift certificate code (if applicable)
- Timestamp

### 4. Payment Success/Failure Logging ✅

**Success Actions:**

- `payment_succeeded` (line 187)
- `gift_certificate_payment_succeeded` (line 261)
- `credit_card_payment_succeeded` (line 333)

**Failure Actions:**

- `payment_rolled_back` (line 391)
- `gift_certificate_payment_failed` (line 253)
- `credit_card_payment_failed` (line 345)
- `rollback_failed` (line 398)

**Details Captured:**

- Success: Amount, method, Stripe Payment ID, amount applied
- Failure: Error message, reason for rollback
- Rollback: Original error and rollback error (if rollback fails)

### 5. Gift Certificate Application Logging ✅

**Actions:**

- `gift_certificate_payment_attempt` (line 240)
- `gift_certificate_payment_succeeded` (line 261)
- `gift_certificate_payment_failed` (line 253)

**Details Captured:**

- Gift certificate code
- Amount to redeem
- Amount actually applied
- Remaining balance after redemption
- Error message (if failed)

### 6. Refunds and Voids Logging ✅

**Location:** [app/actions/payments.ts:601-675](../app/actions/payments.ts)

**Actions:**

- `refund_initiated` (line 631)
- `stripe_refund_created` (line 645)
- `refund_completed` (line 666)

**Details Captured:**

- Who initiated the refund (email)
- Reason for refund
- Stripe refund ID
- Refund status
- Timestamp

**Access Control:**

- Only OWNER role can process refunds
- Verified at line 609

### 7. Audit Log Viewing Page ✅

**Location:** [app/dashboard/payments/audit/page.tsx](../app/dashboard/payments/audit/page.tsx)

**Features:**

- **Access Control:** Only OWNER role can view (redirects STAFF to dashboard)
- **Filtering:** Filter by specific payment ID via query parameter
- **Recent Logs:** Shows last 100 audit log entries by default
- **Full Context:** Includes payment details, appointment, client, service, and staff information
- **Interactive Table:** Client-side component with expandable details

**Client Component:** [app/dashboard/payments/audit/AuditLogTable.tsx](../app/dashboard/payments/audit/AuditLogTable.tsx)

**UI Features:**

- Payment filter dropdown
- Color-coded action badges (success=green, failure=red, pending=yellow)
- Expandable rows to view full JSON details
- Summary statistics:
  - Total events
  - Successful events
  - Failed events
  - Unique payments tracked
- Human-readable action names (e.g., "Payment Succeeded" instead of "payment_succeeded")

### 8. Audit Trail Completeness Testing ✅

**Location:** [scripts/test-audit-trail.ts](../scripts/test-audit-trail.ts)

**Test Scenarios:**

1. ✅ All payments have audit logs (no orphaned payments)
2. ✅ Completed payments have required events (`source_selected`, `payment_succeeded`)
3. ✅ Failed payments have rollback logs
4. ✅ Refunded payments have refund logs
5. ✅ Gift certificate payments have certificate-specific logs
6. ✅ Audit logs are chronologically ordered

**How to Run:**

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx tsx scripts/test-audit-trail.ts
```

**Test Results:** All tests passing ✅

## Database Schema

**PaymentAuditLog Model:**

```prisma
model PaymentAuditLog {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  paymentId String
  payment   Payment  @relation(fields: [paymentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  action    String   // Action type (e.g., "source_selected", "payment_succeeded")
  details   Json     // Stores all relevant context
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([paymentId])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@index([action])
}
```

**Indexes:**

- `paymentId` - Fast lookup of all logs for a specific payment
- `createdAt` - Time-based queries and ordering
- `action` - Filter by specific action types

## Complete List of Audit Actions

### Payment Flow

1. `source_selected` - User selects payment source
2. `gift_certificate_payment_attempt` - Attempting to use gift certificate
3. `gift_certificate_payment_succeeded` - Gift certificate successfully applied
4. `gift_certificate_payment_failed` - Gift certificate failed to apply
5. `credit_card_payment_attempt` - Attempting credit card charge
6. `stripe_payment_intent_created` - Stripe Payment Intent created
7. `credit_card_payment_succeeded` - Credit card charge succeeded
8. `credit_card_payment_failed` - Credit card charge failed
9. `manual_payment_processed` - Cash/Other payment recorded
10. `payment_succeeded` - Overall payment succeeded
11. `payment_rolled_back` - Payment failed and was rolled back
12. `rollback_failed` - Rollback itself failed (critical error)

### Stripe Elements Flow

13. `payment_confirmed_via_stripe_elements` - Updated existing payment
14. `payment_created_from_stripe_elements` - Created new payment

### Refund Flow

15. `refund_initiated` - Refund process started
16. `stripe_refund_created` - Stripe refund created
17. `refund_completed` - Refund successfully processed

## Critical Guarantees

✅ **Every payment decision is logged** - Source selection, attempts, success, failure
✅ **Automatic rollback logging** - Failed payments are always logged
