# Payment Processing System

## Overview

This directory contains the **CRITICAL** payment processing implementation for SalonBase MVP. The payment system is designed with one primary goal: **ZERO payment errors**, especially preventing gift certificates from accidentally charging credit cards.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **PaymentSourceSelector** ([PaymentSourceSelector.tsx](PaymentSourceSelector.tsx))
   - Explicit UI for payment source selection with radio buttons
   - Gift certificates are ALWAYS shown FIRST with green highlight border
   - Shows gift certificate balance prominently
   - Displays warning if user tries to select credit card when gift certificate is available
   - Validates gift certificate codes in real-time
   - Calculates remaining balance after partial gift certificate redemption

2. **PaymentConfirmationModal** ([PaymentConfirmationModal.tsx](PaymentConfirmationModal.tsx))
   - Requires explicit user confirmation before ANY payment processing
   - Shows clear summary of payment amount and method
   - For gift certificates: shows current balance, amount to apply, and remaining balance
   - For credit cards: shows clear warning that card will be charged immediately

3. **PaymentProcessor** ([PaymentProcessor.tsx](PaymentProcessor.tsx))
   - Orchestrates the complete payment flow
   - Manages payment state (idle, processing, success, failed)
   - Implements retry logic (max 2 attempts)
   - Shows real-time payment status to user
   - Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Server Actions

**[app/actions/payments.ts](../../app/actions/payments.ts)**

Core payment processing logic with:

- **processPayment**: Main payment processing function with full audit trail
- **processGiftCertificatePayment**: Dedicated handler for gift certificate redemption
- **processCreditCardPayment**: Stripe Payment Intent creation and confirmation
- **processManualPayment**: Handler for cash and other payment methods
- **rollbackPayment**: Automatic rollback on payment failures
- **getPaymentByAppointmentId**: Retrieve payment details
- **getPaymentAuditLog**: View complete audit trail for a payment
- **refundPayment**: Process refunds (OWNER only)

## Payment Source Hierarchy (CRITICAL)

The payment system enforces this strict hierarchy:

1. ✅ **Check for available gift certificates FIRST**
   - Gift certificates are auto-selected if available and sufficient balance
   - Shown with prominent green highlight border
   - Balance displayed clearly

2. ✅ **Explicit payment source selection required**
   - User MUST select their payment method via radio buttons
   - No automatic fallback to credit cards

3. ✅ **Warning when bypassing gift certificates**
   - If user has a gift certificate but selects credit card, a yellow warning banner appears
   - User must consciously acknowledge they're bypassing their gift certificate

4. ✅ **Confirmation required before charging**
   - PaymentConfirmationModal shows exactly what will be charged
   - User must click "Confirm Payment" to proceed

5. ✅ **Complete audit trail**
   - Every payment decision is logged to PaymentAuditLog
   - Includes: source selection, payment attempts, successes, failures, rollbacks

## Audit Logging

Every payment action is logged to `PaymentAuditLog` table with the following actions:

- `source_selected` - User selected a payment source
- `gift_certificate_payment_attempt` - Attempting to redeem gift certificate
- `gift_certificate_payment_succeeded` - Gift certificate redeemed successfully
- `gift_certificate_payment_failed` - Gift certificate redemption failed
- `credit_card_payment_attempt` - Attempting to charge credit card
- `stripe_payment_intent_created` - Stripe Payment Intent created
- `credit_card_payment_succeeded` - Credit card charged successfully
- `credit_card_payment_failed` - Credit card charge failed
- `manual_payment_processed` - Cash or other payment recorded
- `payment_rolled_back` - Payment failed and was rolled back
- `rollback_failed` - Rollback itself failed (critical error)
- `refund_initiated` - Refund process started
- `stripe_refund_created` - Stripe refund created
- `refund_completed` - Refund completed successfully

## Payment Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. PaymentProcessor renders PaymentSourceSelector          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Check for available gift certificates                    │
│    - If found with sufficient balance → auto-select         │
│    - If found with insufficient balance → show warning      │
│    - If not found → show manual entry option                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. User selects payment source (radio button)               │
│    - Gift Certificate (green highlight)                     │
│    - Credit Card (with warning if gift cert exists)         │
│    - Cash                                                    │
│    - Other                                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. User clicks "Continue to Payment"                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. PaymentConfirmationModal appears                         │
│    - Shows amount, method, balance changes                  │
│    - Requires explicit confirmation                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. User clicks "Confirm Payment"                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 7. processPayment server action executes                    │
│    - Creates Payment record (status: PENDING)               │
│    - Logs source selection to audit trail                   │
│    - Processes payment based on source type                 │
│    - On success: updates to COMPLETED                       │
│    - On failure: rolls back to FAILED                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 8. Payment status displayed to user                         │
│    - Success: Green checkmark, success message              │
│    - Failure: Red X, error message, retry button (if <2)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Safety Guarantees

### 🎯 Primary Guarantee: Gift Certificates NEVER Accidentally Charge Credit Cards

This is enforced at MULTIPLE levels:

1. **UI Level**:
   - Gift certificates shown FIRST with visual prominence (green border)
   - Warning banner if user tries to select credit card when gift cert exists
   - Explicit radio button selection required

2. **Component Level**:
   - PaymentSourceSelector returns `null` until user makes explicit selection
   - PaymentProcessor disables "Continue" button until source is selected
   - No automatic source selection except for gift certificates

3. **Confirmation Level**:
   - PaymentConfirmationModal shows exactly what will be charged
   - User must click "Confirm Payment" to proceed
   - No silent or automatic charging

4. **Server Level**:
   - processPayment requires explicit `paymentSource.type`
   - Each payment method has dedicated handler function
   - No fallback logic that could bypass user's selection

5. **Audit Level**:
   - Every payment decision is logged with timestamp
   - Can trace exactly what user selected and when
   - Audit logs are immutable (no updates, only inserts)

### Other Safety Features

- ✅ **Automatic Rollback**: If payment fails, status is set to FAILED and logged
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Max 2 retry attempts, then user must contact support
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: Gift certificate redemption uses database transactions
- ✅ **Validation**: Amount validation, certificate expiration checking, balance verification
- ✅ **Error Handling**: All errors caught, logged, and displayed to user

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { PaymentProcessor } from '@/components/payment'

function AppointmentCheckout({ appointmentId, amount }) {
  // Fetch available gift certificates for the client
  const giftCertificates = [
    { code: 'ABCD-EFGH-IJKL', balance: 100 }
  ]

  // Fetch saved cards (if any)
  const savedCards = [
    { id: 'pm_123', last4: '4242', brand: 'Visa' }
  ]

  return (
    <PaymentProcessor
      appointmentId={appointmentId}
      amount={amount}
      availableGiftCertificates={giftCertificates}
      savedCards={savedCards}
      onPaymentComplete={(result) => {
        if (result.success) {
          console.log('Payment successful:', result.paymentId)
          // Redirect to confirmation page
        } else {
          console.error('Payment failed:', result.error)
          // Show error message
        }
      }}
      onCancel={() => {
        // Handle cancellation
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Testing

Run the payment processing test suite:

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx tsx scripts/test-payment-processing.ts
```

This test verifies:
- ✅ Payment schema is correctly configured
- ✅ Payment audit logging works correctly
- ✅ Payment rollback mechanism works
- ✅ Gift certificate priority is enforced
- ✅ All payment decisions are logged for audit trail

## Future Enhancements

The following features are planned but not yet implemented:

- [ ] Stripe Elements integration for credit card input
- [ ] 3D Secure (SCA) authentication handling
- [ ] Partial payments (gift cert + credit card for remaining balance)
- [ ] Payment receipt generation and email delivery
- [ ] Saved payment methods management
- [ ] Recurring payments for memberships

## Security Notes

- **PCI Compliance**: Never store credit card details. Use Stripe for all card processing.
- **Audit Logging**: Never delete or modify audit logs. They are immutable for compliance.
- **Refunds**: Only salon OWNER can process refunds (role-based access control).
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are set.

## Support

For issues or questions about the payment system:
1. Check the audit logs: `getPaymentAuditLog(paymentId)`
2. Review error logs in Sentry (when configured)
3. Contact development team with payment ID and timestamp
