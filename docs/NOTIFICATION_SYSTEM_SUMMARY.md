## Database Schema Changes

### New Model: Notification

```prisma
enum NotificationType {
  APPOINTMENT_CONFIRMATION
  APPOINTMENT_REMINDER
  APPOINTMENT_CANCELLED
  APPOINTMENT_RESCHEDULED
  PAYMENT_RECEIPT
}

enum NotificationStatus {
  PENDING
  SENT
  FAILED
  CANCELLED
}

model Notification {
  id          String             @id @default(cuid())
  type        NotificationType
  recipient   String             // Email or phone number
  status      NotificationStatus @default(PENDING)
  scheduledAt DateTime           // When to send the notification
  sentAt      DateTime?          // When it was actually sent
  metadata    Json?              @default("{}") // Additional context (appointmentId, etc.)
  error       String?            @db.Text // Error message if failed
  createdAt   DateTime           @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime           @updatedAt

  @@index([status])
  @@index([scheduledAt])
  @@index([type])
  @@index([status, scheduledAt])
}
```

### Updated Model: Client

Added notification preferences:

```prisma
model Client {
  // ... existing fields
  emailNotificationsEnabled Boolean @default(true)
  smsNotificationsEnabled   Boolean @default(true)
}
```

## How It Works

### Appointment Creation Flow

1. User creates appointment via `createAppointment()` action
2. Appointment saved to database
3. **Notification scheduling (non-blocking):**
   - `scheduleAppointmentConfirmation()` creates notification record
   - Inngest event triggered for immediate sending
   - `scheduleAppointmentReminder()` creates reminder notification
   - Inngest event scheduled for 24 hours before appointment
4. Page revalidated, success returned to user

### Notification Processing Flow

1. Inngest receives event
2. Function fetches appointment with all related data
3. Checks client notification preferences
4. **Email sending (if enabled):**
   - Renders React email template
   - Sends via Resend API
   - Includes unsubscribe link
5. **SMS sending (if enabled):**
   - Formats SMS message from template
   - Sends via Twilio API
6. Updates notification status to SENT/FAILED
7. Logs any errors to notification record

### Rescheduling Flow

1. User updates appointment datetime
2. Old datetime stored
3. **Notification actions:**
   - Send rescheduled notification (immediate)
   - Cancel old pending reminder
   - Schedule new reminder for new datetime

### Cancellation Flow

1. User cancels appointment
2. **Notification actions:**
   - Send cancellation notification (immediate)
   - Cancel pending reminder

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Inngest (Required for notifications)
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY="..."
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY="..."

# Email (Optional - notifications won't send if not configured)
EMAIL_API_KEY="re_..."
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"

# SMS (Optional - notifications won't send if not configured)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="AC..."
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1..."

# App URL (Required for unsubscribe links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Notification System

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-notification-system.ts
```

This will:

- Find a test appointment
- Check notification preferences
- Schedule confirmation and reminder
- Display unsubscribe URLs

### 2. Test Email Deliverability

Requirements:

- Valid `EMAIL_API_KEY` from Resend
- Create an appointment with a client who has an email

Steps:

1. Create appointment
2. Check email inbox
3. Verify confirmation email received
4. Check unsubscribe link works

### 3. Test SMS Delivery

Requirements:

- Valid Twilio credentials
- Create an appointment with a client who has a phone number
- Phone number must be verified in Twilio test mode

Steps:

1. Create appointment
2. Check SMS inbox
3. Verify confirmation SMS received
4. Test STOP keyword for unsubscribe

## API Endpoints

### Inngest Webhook

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/inngest`

Handles Inngest events and function registration.

**Functions:**

- `send-appointment-confirmation`
- `send-appointment-reminder`
- `send-appointment-cancellation`
- `send-appointment-rescheduled`

### Unsubscribe

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/unsubscribe`

**Query Parameters:**

- `clientId` - Client ID to unsubscribe
- `type` - Notification type (`email` or `sms`)

**Response:** HTML success page

**Example:**

```
/api/unsubscribe?clientId=abc123&type=email
```

## Server Actions

### Notification Scheduling

```typescript
// lib/notifications.ts

// Schedule immediate confirmation
await scheduleAppointmentConfirmation(appointmentId);

// Schedule 24-hour reminder
await scheduleAppointmentReminder(appointmentId, appointmentDateTime);

// Send immediate cancellation
await sendAppointmentCancellation(appointmentId);

// Send immediate rescheduled notification
await sendAppointmentRescheduled(appointmentId, oldDateTime, newDateTime);

// Cancel pending reminders
await cancelPendingReminder(appointmentId);
```

## Integration Points

### Appointment Actions

The notification system is integrated into:

1. **`createAppointment()`**
   - Schedules confirmation notification
   - Schedules reminder notification

2. **`updateAppointment()`**
   - Detects rescheduling
   - Sends rescheduled notification
   - Reschedules reminder

3. **`cancelAppointment()`**
   - Sends cancellation notification
   - Cancels pending reminders

All notifications are **non-blocking** - if they fail, the appointment action still succeeds.

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

1. **Notification failures don't fail appointments**
   - All notification calls wrapped in try-catch
   - Errors logged but not thrown
   - User experience unaffected

2. **Missing API keys**
   - Email/SMS skipped if credentials not configured
   - Notification record still created
   - Status marked as FAILED with error message

3. **Client preferences respected**
   - Checks `emailNotificationsEnabled` before sending email
   - Checks `smsNotificationsEnabled` before sending SMS
   - Skips silently if disabled

### Monitoring

All notifications tracked in database:

```typescript
const notifications = await db.notification.findMany({
  where: { status: "FAILED" },
  orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" },
});
```

Check Inngest dashboard for:

- Event history
- Function runs
- Failure rates
- Error logs

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

These items are marked as TODO in the checklist:

1. **Set up Inngest account** - Developer needs to create account and add API keys
2. **Test email deliverability** - Requires Resend API key
3. **Test SMS delivery** - Requires Twilio credentials

Once these are configured, the system will work end-to-end.

## Production Considerations

### Before Launch

1. **Inngest Production Setup**
   - Create production Inngest app
   - Configure production API keys
   - Set up webhook URL

2. **Email Production Setup**
   - Verify domain in Resend
   - Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC records
   - Use production API key

3. **SMS Production Setup**
   - Upgrade Twilio account (remove trial restrictions)
   - Purchase phone number
   - Configure messaging service

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up Sentry alerts for notification failures
   - Monitor Inngest dashboard
   - Track notification delivery rates

### Performance

- Inngest handles retries automatically
- Database indexes on `status`, `scheduledAt`, `type`
- Non-blocking design prevents appointment delays

### Scalability

- Inngest scales automatically
- Background processing prevents blocking
- Database can handle high volume with indexes

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

- Full type safety with Inngest event schemas
- Type-safe notification functions
- Prisma generated types

### Error Handling

- Try-catch blocks for all external API calls
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed error logging

### Testing

- Test script provided
- Integration with appointment flow
- Manual testing guide in docs

## Summary

The notification system is **fully implemented and ready to use** once API credentials are configured. It provides:

- âœ… Automated appointment notifications
- âœ… Email and SMS support
- âœ… Scheduled reminders (24 hours before)
- âœ… Unsubscribe mechanism
- âœ… Full audit trail
- âœ… Error handling and monitoring
- âœ… Non-blocking design
- âœ… Client preference management

**Next steps:** Configure Inngest, Resend, and Twilio API keys to activate the system.
