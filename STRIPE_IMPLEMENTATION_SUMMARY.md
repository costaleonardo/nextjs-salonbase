# Stripe Payment Flow Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Completed Items

All tasks from Phase 2: Payment System - Stripe Payment Flow have been completed:

### 5. ✅ Implement payment success callback
**File:** `app/actions/payments.ts`

- Network condition tests defined

### 9. ✅ Test with various card types (US, international)
**Test Coverage:**

## 🔗 Integration Guide

See example implementation: `docs/examples/stripe-payment-integration.tsx`

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import StripePaymentWrapper from '@/components/payment/StripePaymentWrapper'

<StripePaymentWrapper
  appointmentId={appointment.id}
  amount={appointment.total}
  onSuccess={(paymentIntentId) => {
    // Handle success
  }}
  onError={(error) => {
    // Handle error
  }}
/>
```

### With Confirmation Dialog

```tsx
import PaymentConfirmationDialog from '@/components/payment/PaymentConfirmationDialog'

<PaymentConfirmationDialog
  isOpen={showConfirm}
  onClose={() => setShowConfirm(false)}
  onConfirm={handlePayment}
  paymentDetails={{
    amount: 50.00,
    method: 'CREDIT_CARD',
    cardLast4: '4242'
  }}
  appointmentDetails={{
    clientName: 'John Doe',
    serviceName: 'Haircut',
    dateTime: '2025-10-05 10:00 AM'
  }}
/>
```
