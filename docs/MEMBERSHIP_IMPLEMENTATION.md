# Membership System Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Client Features (Weeks 5-6)
**Status:** ✅ Complete (except mobile testing)

---

## Overview

The membership system has been fully implemented, allowing salons to create tiered membership plans with recurring billing through Stripe subscriptions. Clients can sign up for memberships, and the system handles automatic recurring billing, cancellations, and displays membership benefits throughout the application.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**Models Created:**

- `MembershipTier` - Defines membership plans with pricing and benefits
  - Fields: id, salonId, name, price, benefits (JSON), isActive
  - Indexes: salonId, salonId+isActive

- `Membership` - Tracks client membership subscriptions
  - Fields: id, clientId, salonId, tierId, status, startDate, endDate, stripeSubscriptionId
  - Indexes: clientId, salonId, status, stripeSubscriptionId

**Enums:**

- `MembershipStatus` - ACTIVE, CANCELLED, EXPIRED

**Migration:**

- Already in sync with database (no new migration needed)

### 2. Server Actions ✅

**File:** [app/actions/memberships.ts](../app/actions/memberships.ts)

**Functions Implemented:**

- `createMembershipTier()` - Create new membership tier (OWNER only)
- `getMembershipTiers()` - Fetch all active tiers for a salon
- `createMembership()` - Create new membership with Stripe subscription
  - ✅ Includes retry logic (max 2 attempts)
  - ✅ Creates/retrieves Stripe customer
  - ✅ Attaches payment method
  - ✅ Creates Stripe subscription
  - ✅ Stores subscription ID in database
- `cancelMembership()` - Cancel membership subscription
  - ✅ Cancels Stripe subscription
  - ✅ Updates membership status to CANCELLED
  - ✅ Sets endDate
- `getMembership()` - Get single membership by ID
- `getMemberships()` - Get all memberships for salon (with filters)
- `getActiveMembership()` - Get client's active membership
- `updateMembershipTier()` - Update tier details (OWNER only)

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Full authorization checks (OWNER/STAFF/CLIENT roles)
- ✅ Automatic Stripe customer creation
- ✅ Payment method attachment
- ✅ Retry logic for subscription creation
- ✅ Graceful error handling

### 3. Stripe Webhook Handlers ✅

**File:** [app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts](../app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts)

- `invoice.payment_failed` - Logs failed recurring billing

**Features:**

- ✅ Webhook signature verification

## What Still Needs Testing

### Mobile Testing ⏳

The following items from the checklist still need manual testing:

- [ ] Test mobile membership signup (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Test Stripe Elements on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify touch targets are at least 44x44px
- [ ] Test interrupted signup flow on mobile
- [ ] Verify progress saving works on mobile browsers

**Why This Can't Be Automated:**
Mobile testing requires actual devices or emulators and user interaction testing. The implementation is mobile-optimized (responsive design, localStorage for progress), but needs manual verification.

---

## API Integration

### Stripe Integration

**Environment Variables Required:**

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret key (already configured)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret (already configured)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Client-side publishable key (already configured)

**Subscription Flow:**

1. Client selects membership tier
2. Client enters payment information (Stripe CardElement)
3. Payment method is created via Stripe.js
4. Server Action creates Stripe subscription
5. Subscription returns client secret for payment confirmation
6. Client-side confirms payment
7. Webhook confirms subscription activation
8. Membership status is set to ACTIVE

**Recurring Billing:**

- Stripe automatically handles monthly billing
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook confirms successful payments
- `invoice.payment_failed` webhook logs failed payments
- Stripe handles retry logic automatically

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Membership Tier (Dashboard)

```typescript
// OWNER only
const result = await createMembershipTier({
  salonId: "salon_123",
  name: "Premium Membership",
  price: 59.99,
  benefits: {
    "Discount on services": "20% off",
    "Priority booking": "Book up to 60 days in advance",
    "Free service": "1 free basic service per month",
  },
});
```

### Client Signing Up for Membership

```tsx
import MembershipSignup from "@/components/MembershipSignup";

<MembershipSignup
  clientId={client.id}
  salonId={salon.id}
  onSuccess={() => router.push("/portal")}
  onCancel={() => router.back()}
/>;
```

### Displaying Membership Benefits

```tsx
import MembershipBenefitsDisplay from "@/components/MembershipBenefitsDisplay"

// Compact mode (sidebar)
<MembershipBenefitsDisplay
  salonId={salon.id}
  compact={true}
  title="Join Our Membership"
/>

// Full mode (dedicated page section)
<MembershipBenefitsDisplay
  salonId={salon.id}
  title="Membership Plans"
/>
```

### Checking Active Membership

```typescript
const result = await getActiveMembership(clientId);
if (result.success && result.data) {
  const membership = result.data;
  console.log(`Client has ${membership.tier.name}`);
  console.log(`Benefits:`, membership.tier.benefits);
}
```

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Why Stripe Subscriptions?

- Native recurring billing support
- Automatic retry logic for failed payments
- Webhook-based status updates
- PCI compliance handled by Stripe
- Industry standard for subscription management

### 2. Why localStorage for Progress Saving?

- Works offline
- No database writes for incomplete flows
- Simple implementation
- Automatically cleaned up on success
- Mobile browser compatible

### 3. Why Retry Logic in Server Actions?

- Network failures are common
- Stripe API can have transient errors
- Better user experience than showing error immediately
- Matches CLAUDE.md requirement: "max 2 attempts"

### 4. Why JSON for Benefits?

- Flexible schema (different tiers can have different benefits)
- Easy to display dynamically
- No need for complex relational schema
- Simple to add/edit via admin UI

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- All queries use indexes (clientId, salonId, status, stripeSubscriptionId)
- Memberships are included in existing client queries (no N+1 issues)
- Tier queries are cached on client-side components

### Stripe API Calls

- Subscription creation: ~1-2 seconds
- Cancellation: ~1 second
- Webhooks: Asynchronous, no user-facing delay

### Caching Opportunities (Future)

- Membership tiers can be cached in Redis (rarely change)
- Active membership status can be cached for 5 minutes
- Not implemented yet (Phase 4: Redis setup)

---

## Security

### Authorization

- ✅ Tier creation: OWNER only
- ✅ Tier editing: OWNER only
- ✅ Membership cancellation: OWNER, STAFF, or CLIENT (own membership)
- ✅ All mutations check session and roles

### Stripe Security

- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Payment methods never stored in database
- ✅ Only Stripe subscription ID is stored
- ✅ Client secret only returned for payment confirmation

### Data Validation

- ✅ Email required for membership creation (Stripe requirement)
- ✅ Price must be valid Decimal
- ✅ Benefits must be valid JSON

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Trial Periods** - Not implemented in MVP
   - Can be added by modifying Stripe subscription creation

2. **No Prorated Billing** - Stripe handles this automatically
   - No custom logic needed

3. **No Membership Upgrades/Downgrades** - Not in Phase 3 scope
   - Would require subscription modification logic

4. **No Membership Pausing** - Not in Phase 3 scope
   - Stripe supports this, just not implemented

5. **Mobile Testing Incomplete** - See "What Still Needs Testing" section

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Launch)

1. ⏳ Test membership signup on iOS Safari
2. ⏳ Test membership signup on Android Chrome
3. ⏳ Verify progress saving works on mobile
4. ⏳ Test interrupted signup flow recovery

### Phase 4 (Post-Launch)

1. Add membership tier management UI for OWNER
2. Add membership upgrade/downgrade flow
3. Implement trial periods
4. Add membership analytics dashboard
5. Create membership renewal reminder emails

---

## Troubleshooting

### Subscription Creation Fails

- Check Stripe API keys are set correctly
- Verify client has email address
- Check Stripe logs in dashboard
- Review server action logs

### Webhooks Not Received

- Verify webhook secret is correct
- Check webhook endpoint is accessible
- Use Stripe CLI for local testing: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Review webhook logs in Stripe dashboard

### Membership Status Not Updating

- Check webhook handlers are working
- Verify subscription ID is stored correctly
- Review payment audit logs
- Check for database transaction errors
