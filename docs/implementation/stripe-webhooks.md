# Stripe Webhooks Implementation

**Completed:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented a complete Stripe webhook handler to process payment events asynchronously. The webhook handler updates payment statuses in the database and creates comprehensive audit logs for all payment events.

### Handled Events

#### 1. `payment_intent.succeeded`
- **Action:** Updates payment status from `PENDING` → `COMPLETED`
- **Audit Log:** Creates entry with action `payment_succeeded`
- **Metadata:** Stores completion timestamp and payment details

#### 2. `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- **Action:** Updates payment status from `PENDING` → `FAILED`
- **Audit Log:** Creates entry with action `payment_failed`
- **Metadata:** Stores error message, error code, and failure timestamp

#### 3. `charge.refunded`
- **Action:** Updates payment status from `COMPLETED` → `REFUNDED`
- **Audit Log:** Creates entry with action `payment_refunded`
- **Metadata:** Stores refunded amount, charge ID, and refund reason

## Security Features

### Webhook Signature Verification
- ✅ Validates all webhook requests using Stripe signature
- ✅ Rejects unsigned or tampered requests
- ✅ Uses `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
- ✅ Prevents spoofing attacks

### Database Transactions
- ✅ All updates wrapped in database transactions
- ✅ Atomic updates (payment + audit log together)
- ✅ Automatic rollback on errors

## Audit Logging

Every webhook event creates a detailed audit log entry:

```typescript
{
  paymentId: string,
  action: "payment_succeeded" | "payment_failed" | "payment_refunded",
  details: {
    event: string,
    stripePaymentIntentId: string,
    amount: number,
    currency: string,
    timestamp: string,
    // ... additional event-specific details
  }
}
```

This ensures **complete traceability** for all payment events, which is critical for:
- Dispute resolution
- Debugging payment issues
- Compliance and auditing
- Customer support

## Testing

### Local Testing Setup

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```

2. **Login to Stripe:**
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Start webhook forwarding:**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

4. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:webhooks
   ```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test successful payment
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

# Test failed payment
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed

# Test refund
stripe trigger charge.refunded
```

### Verification

- Check terminal logs for webhook processing messages
- Use Prisma Studio to verify database updates: `npm run db:studio`
- Check `PaymentAuditLog` table for audit entries

## Production Deployment

### 1. Create Webhook Endpoint in Stripe

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `charge.refunded`

### 2. Configure Environment Variable

Add webhook signing secret to production environment:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

In Vercel:
- Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
- Or via CLI: `vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production`

## Error Handling

### Logged Errors
- Missing signature header
- Signature verification failure
- Payment not found for PaymentIntent
- Database transaction errors

### Response Codes
- `200` - Webhook processed successfully
- `400` - Invalid signature or missing header
- `500` - Internal processing error

### Logging
All webhook events are logged with context:
```
[Stripe Webhook] Received event: payment_intent.succeeded (evt_...)
[Stripe Webhook] Payment X marked as COMPLETED (appointment: Y)
```

## Integration with Payment Flow

### Before Webhooks
1. Client creates Payment Intent via app
2. Payment record created with status: `PENDING`
3. Client completes payment in browser
4. **Payment Intent succeeds in Stripe**

### After Webhooks (Asynchronous)
5. Stripe sends `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook
6. Webhook handler verifies signature
7. Payment status updated to `COMPLETED`
8. Audit log created
9. Customer can see completed payment status

## Critical Notes

⚠️ **Payment Processing:**
- Webhooks are the **source of truth** for payment status
- Never rely solely on client-side confirmation
- Always check payment status in database before fulfilling services

⚠️ **Idempotency:**
- Stripe may send duplicate webhook events
- Current implementation handles duplicates gracefully
- Status updates are idempotent (can be applied multiple times)

⚠️ **Timing:**
- Webhooks are asynchronous (may arrive seconds after payment)
- Show "Processing..." state in UI until webhook processes
- Poll payment status or use websockets for real-time updates

## Success Criteria

✅ **All completed:**
- [x] Webhook signature verification implemented
- [x] All three critical events handled
- [x] Database updates with transactions
- [x] Comprehensive audit logging
- [x] Testing documentation created
- [x] Verification script created
- [x] Local testing validated

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard (production)
- [ ] Test webhook delivery in production environment
- [ ] Monitor webhook failures in Stripe dashboard

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add webhook retry logic for failed deliveries
- [ ] Implement webhook event replay for debugging
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for webhook failures
- [ ] Create admin UI to view webhook history
- [ ] Add support for additional events (e.g., disputes, subscription events)
